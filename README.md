# 🎺 DrillFlow

**DrillFlow** is the next generation drill app for marching bands, drum corps, and college programs.
Built as a modern, open, and minimal alternative to UDBapp — DrillFlow puts clarity, speed, and live action at the center of rehearsal.

No more clutter. No more confusion. Just drill, flow, and results.

## 🚀 Why DrillFlow?
UDBapp works, but directors and marchers know the pain:
- Cluttered UI
- Hard to find sets quickly
- Drill and music split between multiple apps
- Limited control for directors in real time

**DrillFlow solves these problems** with a modern stack, a clear interface, and features that actually improve rehearsal flow.

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express / NestJS
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (cloud-hosted)
- **Sync:** WebSockets for real-time updates
